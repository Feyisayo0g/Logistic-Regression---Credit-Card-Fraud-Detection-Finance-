# Logistic-Regression--Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Finance-
Predict Credit Card Fraud Using Logistic Regression

### Executive Summary
This project utilized a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing transaction data, including features like transaction amount, payment type, and account balances, the model was trained to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 83% on test data, effectively identifying patterns associated with fraudulent activity.

### Project Objective
The primary goal of this project was to develop a predictive model using Logistic Regression to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing a dataset of 1,000 simulated transactions, the objective was to identify patterns that distinguish fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones. This model aims to provide a robust method for financial institutions to mitigate the risk of fraud and protect customer assets.

### Importance of the Final Report
Credit card fraud is a significant global issue, resulting in billions of dollars in losses each year. The final report of this project provides critical insights into the factors that contribute to fraudulent activities. By identifying these factors, financial institutions can implement more effective preventive measures, ensuring greater security for their customers. The model developed in this project not only enhances fraud detection capabilities but also contributes to reducing the overall financial impact of fraud on both customers and companies.

### Methodology
#### Data Collection
The dataset used in this project, transactions_modified.csv, contains 1,000 records of simulated credit card transactions. Each transaction is characterized by multiple features, such as the transaction amount, account balances, and the type of transaction (e.g., payment, cash out).

### Dataset Overview:
- Total Transactions: 1,000
- Fraudulent Transactions: Identified through the isFraud column.

### Key Features:
- amount: The value of the transaction.
- isPayment: Indicates if the transaction was a payment or debit.
- isMovement: Indicates if the transaction involved a transfer or cash out.
- accountDiff: The absolute difference between the origin and destination account balances.
